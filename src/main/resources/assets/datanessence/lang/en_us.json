Essence is channeled through the lensing crystal in the obsidian base, amplified by the conductive metal frame into the items being worked with. It behaves otherwise as an ordinary workbench.\n\nThe device must be activated with a particular tool for it to craft.",

Its contents may be added to by visiting any active research center and copying data from its Data Bank, assuming sufficient credentials.\n\nThe Data Tablet contains security mechanisms which prevent a Tablet from accepting data of a higher tier than itself, as well as requiring specific, highly-encrypted critical data and authorization from higher-ranked peers to rise in tier. This is to ensure our gathered knowledge of Essence does not fall into the wrong hands.",

As this gas dissipates, it leaves behind usable Essence with which to supply machinery.\n\nThe Burner device does exactly this, featuring a chamber in which to insert Shards and fuel, as well as a grate on the top that harmlessly vents the gas.",
