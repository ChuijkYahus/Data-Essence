  "data_tablet.pages.essence.page1.text": "Essence, as should be evident, is a magical force or energy that is highly workable - receptive and eager to bend to the commands we issue via our engineering. We have noted that it comes in several types, but for security's sake I have been advised to detail only the basic one herein. The purple variant of Essence, which is called simply that, has strong ties to industry, processing, and electricity. It is naturally occurring in Phenua, in living things and in crystals, both of which are amenable to extraction - though not all life is exactly favorable of being siphoned out of. Its applications are wide: from menial labor to refined industrial processes, Essence is the backbone of any capable factory.",

  "data_tablet.pages.phenuan_material_studies.page1.text": "Copper serves as a nice replacement to our native conductive alloys, able to conduct Essence with ease. It proves flexible, yet sturdy, and produces a beautiful orange color when treated for our work - which many of our builders have taken a liking to. Copper densely saturates the Phenuan overworld's caves, and thus we are in no shortage of raw metal stock for our artifices and production lines.",
  "data_tablet.pages.phenuan_material_studies.page2.text": "Amethyst is a magenta gemstone whose properties as a lens and focus make it a workable substitute to lensing crystals. It is often used in cases where the quality of the lens does not matter as much, but for especially sensitive devices, they prove incapable. To the locals, this gemstone seems to be representative of time. We have noted this for future study.",
  "data_tablet.pages.phenuan_material_studies.page3.text": "Obsidian bears very unique properties in Phenua. As opposed to the fragility we are more familiar with, Phenuan obsidian is oddly sturdy and soaks up Essence like a sponge. This has led to very favorable results when constructing devices and structures from it. Some of our older researchers have proposed a potential similarity between it and our native crystalline stone in this regard - again, something to consider for further research.",
