Its contents may be added to by visiting any active research center and copying data from its Data Bank, assuming sufficient credentials.\n\nThe Data Tablet contains security mechanisms which prevent a Tablet from accepting data of a higher tier than itself, as well as requiring specific, highly-encrypted critical data and authorization from higher-ranked peers to rise in tier. This is to ensure our gathered knowledge of Essence does not fall into the wrong hands.",

As this gas dissipates, it leaves behind usable Essence with which to supply machinery.\n\nThe Burner device does exactly this, featuring a chamber in which to insert Shards and fuel, as well as a grate on the top that harmlessly vents the gas.",
  "data_tablet.pages.essence_burner.page2.text":   " ◇ Requires: Essence Shards and furnace fuel (eg. coal, charcoal, etc).\n ◇ Needs no coolant.\n ◇ Risks: None.",

  "data_tablet.pages.essence_transfer.page1.text": "Generation of Essence is rather useless if it can't be sent to the devices that require it. Thus, we have devised Wires and Points:\n\nWires are shaped out of conductive metal and coated in a reactive mixture, that coaxes Essence to flow along it from point to point.\n\nPoints are simply attachments for wires, able to act as in- and outputs, and relays for longer distance connections or power lines.",

  "data_tablet.pages.infuser.page1.text":       "The Fabricator is an ideal worktable for more refined processing, but there are times when what is required is to dump Essence into an object without much finesse. That is where the Infuser device comes in: it is able to infuse blocks and items with Essence, often resulting in something new, or changed.",

  "data_tablet.pages.laser_emitter.page2.text": " ◇ No Lens: The Emitter produces a redstone signal when mobs touch the beam.\n ◇ Acceleration Lens: Mobs are forced to move in the direction of the beam.\n ◇ Burning Lens: Mobs are ignited.\n ◇ Harming Lens: Mobs are damaged.\n ◇ Healing Lens: Mobs are healed.\n ◇ Precision Lens: The Emitter emits redstone correspondent to the number of mobs the beam intersects with.",

We found that shaping them into bricks was of aesthetic interest, and the result was the Traversite Road.",

  "data_tablet.pages.essence_bombs.page1.text":              "By packing Essence into a tightly-enclosed spherical shell along with some unstable matter, we found ourselves with a form of explosive artillery. It was suggested that we strictly regulate their manufacture, but there's little point: the formula is decently simple.\n\nThe basic Essence Bomb is simply a projectile that causes a nice explosion where it lands.",
  "data_tablet.pages.primitive_antigravity_pack.name":       "Antigravity Pack",
  "data_tablet.pages.primitive_antigravity_pack.page1.text": "As travel between research centers often involves crossing uneven terrain, such as cliffs or mountains, some measure of protection from lethal falls is desirable. Our first developments into the matter led us to the Primitive Antigravity Pack, which is able to provide some measure of grace during falls when charged up with Essence.",

  "data_tablet.pages.charger.page1.text":                    "A device may be constructed that channels Essence along a pair of exciters into an item, thereby charging it with Essence. This charger is therefore invaluable in the fuelling of tools and equipment - instead of having to carry an entire Essence Battery around and somehow connect the item to it, which would be, in this researcher's opinion, asinine.",
