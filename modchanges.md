### Additions
- Essence Meter, a tool you can use on blocks with no gui display (such as Buffers) to see how much Essence they contain

### Changes
- Tweaked UnderTheSky music disc texture
- Added wires minigames to the data bank entries for the Essence Leech and Industrial Plant Siphon
- Messed with the internals for rendering essence bars so that the essence bar background is rendered with the bar instead of being part of the gui sprite
- Tweaked some smaller internal stuff

### Fixes
- Adapted to some small databank tweaks
- Fixed Fluid Mixer crashing
