### Additions
- New Drying Table machine - fluid and an optional additive undergo an accelerated drying process thanks to Essence, yielding a resultant item (such as water + sand = clay)
- New Hammer and Chisel tool for expedited gathering of any block tagged #datanessence:hammer_and_chisel_collectable, such as obsidian and similar blocks; available from the start
- Added EMI Handler for Melting recipes
- Added new Melting recipes for Mud, Magma, Netherrack, and Stone

### Changes
- Data Banks show a hint that suggests you return later when there are no entries to display
- Buffers display upwards moving particles when transferring
- Coal Lumps are now 8:1 with Coal, for consistency with other mods that add coal fragments
- EMI Plugin no longer shows recipes from incomplete entries, as to avoid spoiling puzzle solutions in the future

### Fixes
- Coal Lumps had no burn time in furnaces/etc; now they burn for 200 ticks
- Some Machines refused to work if their stored Essence went under the amount required for the recipe
- Amethyst Shard > Essence Shard recipe was erroneously hidden in the tablet
- Mineral Purification Chamber didn't receive water from a buffer
- Lensing Crystal Ore and Lensing Crystal were lacking tags
- Wire Spool had incorrect entry lock
