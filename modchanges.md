### Additions
- Added some new variants of Polished Obsidian (Bricks, Tract)
- Added a variant of Node/Wire for Mekanism Chemicals
- Added Dewlamps, a decorative light fixture - recipe is temporary until a certain place gets added
- Added lore entry about Ancient Rock, found at Tier 2 in Nature Outposts and Ancient Weapons Facilities

### Changes
- Blacklisted Structure Protectors from being relocated by (hopefully) many mods
- Various internal changes to the Mote particle
- Ancient Rock blocks cannot be broken by non-players anymore - as a side effect, mods like Jade unfortunately don't show their harvestability for now
- Essence Breaker checks if a block is supposed to be unbreakable before breaking it

### Fixes
- Wire Spools required the Synthesis Chamber to be unlocked despite being a crafting component
