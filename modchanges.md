### Additions
- Added the Traversite Trudgers, a pair of boots unlockable in Tier 1 from Nature Outposts that prevent a good chunk of the environment - things such as soul sand, webs, honey, or ice - from slowing you down
- EMI plugin displays that DnE's machines can be used for some vanilla recipe types (crafting, smelting)
- EMI plugin hides recipes you have not gotten the data for yet, to reduce progression confusion

### Fixes
- Abandoned Factory chains are not waterlogged anymore
