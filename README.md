# HALCYON

> To beget change, one must consider first the nature of its recipient. This is easily done: evidence of a scarred past is all around, clinging to the world like detritus in water that needs but a single motion to stir to the surface. A tablet rests high in snow-capped dark cradled by a feathered hand. The past is opening itself to you. It just takes one step, one fleeting motion to behold. Will you do it?
>
> The road onto which you will embark stretches high and low, twisting through other realms alien and familiar. The ascent will be vast, but so too will be its spoils. The further you go, the more you must bear in mind your goal. To beget change, one must ultimately embody its agent.
>
> This is **Halcyon**, a story of reconciliation told through your discoveries and experiments surrounding once-forgotten magitech machinery and its architects. Through artifice, grow familiar with the ebbs and flows of the Tides. Unearth a lost history, and realize it was not lost at all. Explore, construct, make contact, learn. And at the end of all things, when the lights in the sky are dim and clouded in mist and the tablet in your hands reflects that which you always knew to be real, you will make your role clear, and bear witness to your endeavor's conclusion.
>
> *Reconcile.*
